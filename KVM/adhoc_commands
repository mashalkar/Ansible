Before running below commands, you need to create a ansible.cfg where you mention the inventory file which will be used while running anisble ad-hoc commands

# *List the VMs on the KVM host or hosts*
` ansible beaker -m virt -a "command=list_vms"`
This list can be then used to create inventory file for VMs.

# Check VM status
` ansible beaker -m virt -a "name=<vm-name> command=status" `
